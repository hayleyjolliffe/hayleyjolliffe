Designer and developer focused on building opinionated, purpose-first software that gets out of the way. My work lives at the intersection of systems thinking, digital minimalism, and early computing principles — inspired by Bell Labs, UNIX, and the idea that great tools are meant to be closed. I create products that strip away noise, respect attention, and serve a single clear function — from habit systems to launcher interfaces.

Everything I build reflects a core belief: software should sharpen your intent, not scatter it.
